It is analyzed as two independent motions: Horizontal motion \u2013 constant velocity (no horizontal acceleration if air resistance is ignored). Vertical motion \u2013 uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity. Equations of Projectile Motion Let: - \\( v_0 \\) = Initial velocity - \\( \\theta \\) = Launch angle - \\( g \\) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2) - \\( t \\) = Time 1. Horizontal Motion Velocity: $$ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ (Constant, since no horizontal acceleration) Displacement: $$ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ 2. Vertical Motion Velocity: $$ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Displacement: $$ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time to reach max height: $$ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ Maximum height: $$ h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} $$ 3. Time of Flight The total time the projectile is in the air: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ 4. Range (Horizontal Distance) The total horizontal distance traveled: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Key Points The trajectory is a parabola. The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other. The optimal launch angle for maximum range is 45\u00b0 (without air resistance).","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#projectile-motion-definition-equations","text":"Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, following a parabolic path.
