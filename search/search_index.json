It follows a parabolic trajectory and can be analyzed by breaking it into two independent components: Horizontal Motion \u2013 Constant velocity (no acceleration, assuming no air resistance). Vertical Motion \u2013 Accelerated motion due to gravity \\( g \\) (typically \\( 9.8 \\, m/s^2 \\) downward). Key Equations of Projectile Motion 1. Time of Flight (T) The total time the projectile remains in the air is determined by the vertical motion: [ T = \\frac{2 u \\sin\\theta}{g} ] Where: - \\( u \\) = Initial velocity - \\( \\theta \\) = Angle of projection - \\( g \\) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/s\u00b2) 2. Maximum Height (H) The highest point the projectile reaches: \\[ H = \\frac{(u \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} \\] 3. Horizontal Range (R) The total horizontal distance covered by the projectile: \\[ R = \\frac{u^2 \\sin 2\\theta}{g} \\] 4. Equations of Motion (Components) Horizontal Position (x): [ x = u \\cos\\theta \\cdot t ] Vertical Position (y): [ y = u \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 ] 5. Velocity at Any Time (t) Horizontal Velocity: [ v_x = u \\cos\\theta ] Vertical Velocity: [ v_y = u \\sin\\theta - g t ] Resultant Velocity: [ v = \\sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2} ] Important Points to Remember The horizontal motion is uniform (constant velocity). The vertical motion is accelerated due to gravity. The trajectory is parabolic when air resistance is ignored. The maximum range occurs at 45\u00b0 for a given speed. These formulas are essential for solving problems related to projectile motion in physics! \ud83d\ude80","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"Projectile Motion: Detailed Description with Formulas Projectile motion is the motion of an object under the influence of gravity after being projected into the air.
