It is analyzed as two independent motions: Horizontal motion \u2013 constant velocity (no horizontal acceleration if air resistance is ignored). Vertical motion \u2013 uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity. Equations of Projectile Motion Let: - \\( v_0 \\) = Initial velocity - \\( \\theta \\) = Launch angle - \\( g \\) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s\u00b2) - \\( t \\) = Time 1. Horizontal Motion Velocity: $$ v_x = v_0 \\cos\\theta $$ (Constant, since no horizontal acceleration) Displacement: $$ x = v_0 \\cos\\theta \\cdot t $$ 2. Vertical Motion Velocity: $$ v_y = v_0 \\sin\\theta - g t $$ Displacement: $$ y = v_0 \\sin\\theta \\cdot t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$ Time to reach max height: $$ t_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ Maximum height: $$ h_{\\text{max}} = \\frac{(v_0 \\sin\\theta)^2}{2g} $$ 3. Time of Flight The total time the projectile is in the air: $$ T = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin\\theta}{g} $$ 4. Range (Horizontal Distance) The total horizontal distance traveled: $$ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} $$ Key Points The trajectory is a parabola.

Types of Four-Bar Linkages: Crank-Rocker Mechanism \u2013 One link rotates fully, and another oscillates. Double Crank Mechanism \u2013 Both links rotate completely. Double Rocker Mechanism \u2013 Both links oscillate. Drag-Link Mechanism \u2013 The shortest link is the ground, and both moving links rotate fully. Key Equations in Four-Bar Linkage 1. Grashof\u2019s Criterion (Mobility Condition) To determine if at least one link can rotate completely, we use the following condition: S + L \u2264 P + Q Where: S = Shortest link L = Longest link P, Q = The other two links If this condition is satisfied, the mechanism allows continuous motion. Velocity Analysis (Relative Velocity Equation) The velocity of a point on a link can be calculated using the Instantaneous Center Method: V = \u03c9 \u00d7 r Where: V = Linear velocity \u03c9 = Angular velocity r = Distance from the pivot For two links in a four-bar mechanism, the ratio of angular velocities is: \u03c9\u2082 / \u03c9\u2081 = L\u2081 / L\u2082 Where: \u03c9\u2081, \u03c9\u2082 = Angular velocities of two links L\u2081, L\u2082 = Lengths of the respective links 3. Acceleration Analysis (Coriolis Acceleration) The total acceleration of a point in a four-bar linkage is the sum of two components: a = \u03b1 \u00d7 r + \u03c9\u00b2 \u00d7 r Where: a = Acceleration \u03b1 = Angular acceleration \u03c9 = Angular velocity r = Distance from the pivot For a slider-crank mechanism (a special case of a four-bar linkage), the Coriolis acceleration is: a\u1d9c = 2\u03c9v Where: a\u1d9c = Coriolis acceleration v = Velocity of the slider 4. Transmission Angle (\u03bc) The transmission angle determines the efficiency of force transfer in the linkage mechanism: \u03bc = cos\u207b\u00b9 [(L\u2082\u00b2 + L\u2083\u00b2 - L\u2084\u00b2) / (2 L\u2082 L\u2083)] Where: L\u2082, L\u2083, L\u2084 = Lengths of the links The best efficiency occurs when the transmission angle \u03bc is close to 90\u00b0.
