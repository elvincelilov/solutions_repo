It is analyzed as two independent motions: Horizontal motion \u2013 constant velocity (no horizontal acceleration if air resistance is ignored). Vertical motion \u2013 uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity.

Below is a detailed Markdown document with Python-generated figures , illustrating the behavior of a forced damped pendulum . Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum 1. Theoretical Foundation The equation governing the motion of a forced damped pendulum is: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + q \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\sin(\\theta) = F \\cos(\\omega t) \\] where: - \\( \\theta \\) is the angular displacement - \\( q \\) is the damping coefficient - \\( F \\) is the driving force amplitude - \\( \\omega \\) is the driving frequency (a) Small Angle Approximation For small angles ( \\( \\theta \\ll 1 \\) ), we approximate \\( \\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta \\) , leading to: \\[ \\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + q \\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\theta = F \\cos(\\omega t) \\] This is a driven damped harmonic oscillator , which exhibits resonance at a specific natural frequency .

(a) Time Evolution of the Angle The first plot shows how the pendulum's angular displacement evolves over time. \ud83d\udccc Observation: - The oscillations are not perfectly sinusoidal , indicating nonlinear effects . - The damping coefficient affects how quickly the motion settles. (b) Phase Space Diagram The phase space plot (angular velocity vs. angle) shows whether the motion is periodic or chaotic . \ud83d\udccc Interpretation: - If the plot forms closed loops , the motion is regular and periodic . - If the motion is scattered , the system is exhibiting chaotic behavior . (c) Poincar\u00e9 Section A Poincar\u00e9 section helps reveal chaotic motion. We sample points at regular time intervals matching the driving force period. \ud83d\udccc Interpretation: - A single point or a few discrete points \u2192 Regular periodic motion - Many scattered points \u2192 Chaotic motion (d) Bifurcation Diagram The bifurcation diagram shows how the system transitions from periodic to chaotic motion as the driving force \\( F \\) is varied. \ud83d\udccc Interpretation: - At low \\( F \\) , the motion is regular and periodic . - As \\( F \\) increases, bifurcations occur, leading to chaotic motion . 3.
