### Projectile Motion: Definition & Equations  

Projectile motion refers to the motion of an object launched into the air under the influence of gravity, following a parabolic path. It is analyzed as two independent motions:  

1. Horizontal motion – constant velocity (no horizontal acceleration if air resistance is ignored).  
2. Vertical motion – uniformly accelerated motion due to gravity.

### Equations of Projectile Motion  

Let:  
- \( v_0 \) = Initial velocity  
- \( \theta \) = Launch angle  
- \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²)  
- \( t \) = Time  

#### 1. Horizontal Motion  
- Velocity:  
  $$ v_x = v_0 \cos\theta $$  
  (Constant, since no horizontal acceleration)  
- Displacement:  
  $$ x = v_0 \cos\theta \cdot t $$  

#### 2. Vertical Motion  
- Velocity:  
  $$ v_y = v_0 \sin\theta - g t $$  
- Displacement:  
  $$ y = v_0 \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2 $$  
- Time to reach max height:  
  $$ t_{\text{max}} = \frac{v_0 \sin\theta}{g} $$  
- Maximum height:  
  $$ h_{\text{max}} = \frac{(v_0 \sin\theta)^2}{2g} $$  

#### 3. Time of Flight  
The total time the projectile is in the air:  
  $$ T = \frac{2 v_0 \sin\theta}{g} $$  

#### 4. Range (Horizontal Distance)  
The total horizontal distance traveled:  
  $$ R = \frac{v_0^2 \sin(2\theta)}{g} $$

### Key Points  
- The trajectory is a parabola.  
- The horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.  
- The optimal launch angle for maximum range is 45° (without air resistance).
