# Problem 1

### **Projectile Motion: Detailed Description with Formulas**  

**Projectile motion** is the motion of an object under the influence of gravity after being projected into the air. It follows a **parabolic trajectory** and can be analyzed by breaking it into two independent components:  

1. **Horizontal Motion** â€“ Constant velocity (no acceleration, assuming no air resistance).  
2. **Vertical Motion** â€“ Accelerated motion due to gravity \( g \) (typically \( 9.8 \, m/s^2 \) downward).  

### **Key Equations of Projectile Motion**  

#### **1. Time of Flight (T)**
The total time the projectile remains in the air is determined by the vertical motion:

\[
T = \frac{2 u \sin\theta}{g}
\]

Where:  
- \( u \) = Initial velocity  
- \( \theta \) = Angle of projection  
- \( g \) = Acceleration due to gravity (9.8 m/sÂ²)  

#### **2. Maximum Height (H)**  
The highest point the projectile reaches:

\[
H = \frac{(u \sin\theta)^2}{2g}
\]

#### **3. Horizontal Range (R)**  
The total horizontal distance covered by the projectile:

\[
R = \frac{u^2 \sin 2\theta}{g}
\]

#### **4. Equations of Motion (Components)**  
- **Horizontal Position (x):**  
\[
x = u \cos\theta \cdot t
\]

- **Vertical Position (y):**  
\[
y = u \sin\theta \cdot t - \frac{1}{2} g t^2
\]

#### **5. Velocity at Any Time (t)**
- **Horizontal Velocity:**  
\[
v_x = u \cos\theta
\]  
- **Vertical Velocity:**  
\[
v_y = u \sin\theta - g t
\]  
- **Resultant Velocity:**  
\[
v = \sqrt{v_x^2 + v_y^2}
\]  

### **Important Points to Remember**
- The horizontal motion is **uniform** (constant velocity).  
- The vertical motion is **accelerated** due to gravity.  
- The trajectory is **parabolic** when air resistance is ignored.  
- The **maximum range** occurs at **45Â°** for a given speed.  

These formulas are essential for solving problems related to projectile motion in physics! ðŸš€
