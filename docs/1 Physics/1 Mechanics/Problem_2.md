# **Investigating the Dynamics of a Forced Damped Pendulum**  

## **1. Theoretical Foundation**  

The equation governing the motion of a **forced damped pendulum** is:  

\[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + q \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \sin(\theta) = F \cos(\omega t)
\]

where:  
- \( \theta \) is the **angular displacement**  
- \( q \) is the **damping coefficient**  
- \( F \) is the **driving force amplitude**  
- \( \omega \) is the **driving frequency**  

### **(a) Small Angle Approximation**
For **small angles** (\( \theta \ll 1 \)), we approximate \( \sin(\theta) \approx \theta \), leading to:

\[
\frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2} + q \frac{d\theta}{dt} + \theta = F \cos(\omega t)
\]

This is a **driven damped harmonic oscillator**, which exhibits resonance at a specific **natural frequency**. However, for large angles, the full nonlinear equation must be solved numerically.

## **2. Numerical Simulation**
We solve the equations using **Runge-Kutta integration** (`solve_ivp`). The system is rewritten as two first-order differential equations:

\[
\frac{d\theta}{dt} = \omega
\]

\[
\frac{d\omega}{dt} = -q \omega - \sin(\theta) + F \cos(\Omega t)
\]

Below is the **Python code** to integrate and analyze the pendulum's motion.

üìå **Observation:**  
- The oscillations are **not perfectly sinusoidal**, indicating **nonlinear effects**.  
- The **damping coefficient** affects how quickly the motion settles.

### **(b) Phase Space Diagram**
The **phase space** plot (angular velocity vs. angle) shows whether the motion is **periodic or chaotic**.

üìå **Interpretation:**  
- If the plot forms **closed loops**, the motion is **regular and periodic**.  
- If the motion is **scattered**, the system is exhibiting **chaotic behavior**.

### **(c) Poincar√© Section**
A **Poincar√© section** helps reveal chaotic motion. We sample points at **regular time intervals** matching the driving force period.

üìå **Interpretation:**  
- **A single point or a few discrete points** ‚Üí **Regular periodic motion**  
- **Many scattered points** ‚Üí **Chaotic motion**

### **(d) Bifurcation Diagram**
The **bifurcation diagram** shows how the system **transitions from periodic to chaotic motion** as the driving force **\( F \)** is varied.

üìå **Interpretation:**  
- At **low \( F \)**, the motion is **regular and periodic**.  
- As \( F \) increases, **bifurcations** occur, leading to **chaotic motion**.
